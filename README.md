# Have-It Inventory Management

## About

This is an inventory management application designed to help you manage
inventory. Whether you need to manage supplies for a bicycle repair shop or your
kitchen pantry, Have-It covers it all.

I have implemented a generic relational database for this project:

1. User has many assemblies and many parts
2. Each assembly belongs to 1 user
3. Each part belongs to 1 user
4. Many assemblies contain 1 or many parts

Feel free to tweak things as you see fit.
